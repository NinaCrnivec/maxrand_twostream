### Delta Eddington Twostream solver mit maximum random cloud overlap assumptions

The code here includes a delta eddington twostream solver with the plane parallel approximation and a maximum random overlap solver.

* Attention: The code here was to get a student started. Not finished nor correctly working at the moment.
Don't use it! Would be nice though if you'd be willing to fix the code :)
Otherwise let me know, I could probably find the time to finish it.

#### Installation
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ./bin/solve
